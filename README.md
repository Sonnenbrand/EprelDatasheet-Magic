# KISS-Light

## Summary
This is a small App for simple automation tasks written in Python and using FLASK Framework. Main thought is K(eep) I(t) S(imple) (Stupid). New feature requests are welcome.

## Functions

### Name
Just a small test where you can enter something into a from and the server will render the template with that input.

### EPRL PIS download and conversion
Upload an Excel file which contains EPREL IDs and language and the tool will genereate the URL for the PIS. You also can download the PIS and even let them be converted to a single file JPG as it is needed e.g. by Amazon when you list products.

### UPCOMING: Shlink Management

## TODO

[ ] Add Input fields to give Shlink Tags or Names who created the Link
[ ] Add some kind of authentication so that not everyone can use the Shlink part
